## Overview 

* A image captioning web app using Flask

* The web app can convert the uploaded picture into a sentence

* The sentence will describe the image

* ResNet50 is used as image model

* It mainly generated the feature vectors of the images

* LSTM is the language model

* It is used to predict the next word from the given image and word input

* To accomplish the purpose I have created my own vocabulary

* The vocabulary is stored as numpy array in the vocab.npy file

* To train the model flickr8k has been used. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/srbhshinde/flickr8k-sau
